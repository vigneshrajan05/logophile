logophile - For the love of words!

This core idea of this project to build a simple vocabulary 
builder game that is different from the usual way of learning words and
their meanings. In traditional way of learning new words, we learn a word 
and its meaning. But in ‘logoPhile’, we provide the user with a meaning of 
the word and hints(if required) and the user will be asked to find the 
correct word representing the meaning, out of all words which are splitted and shuffled. The user will have a fun filled 
learning experience and enrich his/her vocabulary
